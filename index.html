            <P>I've been working with web design since the angelfire pages of the 1990s.  Every website tells a story, and I'm a Responsive Designer & Developer who loves making those stories come to life.  When I'm not working on a project or spending quality time with my children (daughter Tesla Róisín, 6, and son Ernest Jr., 1), I'm most likely enjoying a long highway drive.</P>

            <div class="div-1">
                At first I was afraid.  I was petrified.  I kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.  But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you done me wrong, I grew strong.  I learned how to get along.
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                And so you're back from outer space.  I just walked in to find you here with that look upon your face.  I should've changed my fuckin' lock, I would've made you leave your key if I'd'a known for just one second you'd be back to bother me!
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                Oh now go!  Walk out the door.  Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.  Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?  Did you think I'd crumble?  Did you think I'd lay down and die?  Oh not I!  I will survive!
